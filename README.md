## Introduction  
This challenge is broken into two assignments: WeatherPy and VacationPy  

### WeatherPy:  
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what  
you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental  
question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"  

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed  
for more information, how would you prove that?  

So, in this deliverable we'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500  
cities of varying distances from the equator. We'll use the citipy Python libraryLinks to  
an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and our problem-solving  
skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.  

### VacationPy:  
Well, if we can do that, then surely we can work our magic to plan a perfect destination  
vacation based off of climate. Using the power of a different API and method for calling  
that API (as per usual), we can even graph the data in the form of a map.  

In this deliverable, we'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also,  
we'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API. Our main  
tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and to employ our  
Python skills to create map visualizations.

### Instructions  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Ensure IDE is up to date and running.  
3. Please run the following code in your IDE if the dependencies aren't found:  
    ```
    pip install...
    pip install...
    or
    conda install...
    conda install...
    ```
4. Ensure the input files are in the correct directory.  
5. Open {main_file_name} in your IDE and {perform execution}.

## Files and Directory Structure  
```  
{repo_name}/
|
|— {main_directory}/
|   |— {input_directory}/
|   |   — test1.csv
|   |   - test2.csv
|   |— main...
```  
This structure ensures all inputs are organized within their respective folders.  
Outputs will be created without additional directory structuring  

[:arrow_up: Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)  

## Expected Results  
1. Updated {main...}
2. New directory structure for `{repo_name}`:
```
{repo_name}/
|
|— {main_directory}/
|   |— {input_directory}/
|   |   — test1.csv
|   |   - test2.csv
|   |- {results_directory}/
|   |   - result1.pdf
|   |   - result2.png
|   |   - result3.jpeg
|   |   - result4.py
|   |   - result5.ipynb
|   |— main... (updated)
```
{New directory paths indicate proper running and exporting of data}
